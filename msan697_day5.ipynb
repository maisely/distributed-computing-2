    "    - **Consistency**: Any given transaction must change the affected data \n",
    "    - **Isolated**: Define how/when the changes made by one operation become visible to other. Concurrent ioerations are isolated from each other so that they can't see a partial update.\n",
    "    - **Durable**: Once a transaction has been commited, it will remain permanently. \n",
